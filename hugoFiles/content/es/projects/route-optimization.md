---

Computer Science Engineering thesis. Design and development of metaheuristic technique that allows finding solutions to the milk collection problem with selection and blending.
The algorithm finds optimal solutions for vehicle routing problems with multiple product types.

* Up to 500 nodes to visit.
* Up to 35 simultaneous routes.
* 3 Different qualities of milk.
* Product mixing supported.
* Less than 50 seconds of computation time on the largest instance.
