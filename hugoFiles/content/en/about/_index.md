I'm a final year student of Ingeniería Civil Informática at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María. I'm already finishing my thesis on mathematical optimization with artificial intelligence.
My interest on the computer science fields are optimization, artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Also I studied three years at Ingenieria en Información y Control de Gestión. Despite not having finished it, my business fundamentals are really solid in understanding the problems faced by companies.
